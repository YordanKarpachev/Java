2. Point in Rectangle
Create a class Point and a class Rectangle. The Point should hold coordinates X and Y and the Rectangle should hold 2 Points – its bottom left and top right corners. In the Rectangle class, you should implement a contains(Point point) method that returns true or false, based on whether the Point given as an attribute is inside or outside of the Rectangle object. Points on the side of a Square are considered inside.
Input
    • On the first line read the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corner of the Rectangle in the format: "{bottomLeftX} {bottomLeftY} {topRightX} {topRightY}".
    • On the second line, read an integer N and on the next N lines, read the coordinates of points.
Output
    • For each point, print out the result of the Contains() method.
