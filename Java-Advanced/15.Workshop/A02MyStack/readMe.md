The custom stack will also have similar functionality to the Java ArrayDeque and again, we will make it work only with integers. Later on, we will learn how to implement it in a way that will allow us to work with any type. It will have the following functionality:
    • void push(int element) – Adds the given element to the stack
    • int pop() – Removes the last added element
    • int peek() – Returns the last element in the stack without removing it
    • void forEach(Consumer<Integer> consumer) – Goes through each of the elements in the stack
Feel free to implement your functionality or to write the methods by yourself.
